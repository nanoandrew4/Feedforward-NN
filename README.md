# Feedforward Neural Network

First attempt at designing a Neural Network, after a couple of days of wrestling the relevant calculus and implementing it.
The design is flexible, allowing for any number of layers with any number of neurons.
Currently being used to learn to recognize handwritten digits, and using gradient descent achieving ~85% accurracy.

This network is for learning purposes. This is in no way inteded to be state-of-the-art.
Although I will continue to improve it with new material I learn, I do intend to move on to other types of networks at some point.
Feel free to give it a spin however! It will likely work reasonably well, as I implement alternative learning and training techniques.
